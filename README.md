RoslynSamples
=============

This project contains a small set of sample projects that can get you started with [Roslyn](http://roslyn.codeplex.com/). When finished I aim to have four different projects in the solution:

 * One simple console application
 * One web application that does almost the same as the console application
 * One refactoring project
 * One diagnositic project with refactoring

I'll also try to add tags to the projects, in addition to the commits, as I go along so it is possible to see the changes I made and compare newly started project and finished project.
